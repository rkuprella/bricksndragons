      <h2>Hello world</h2>
      <p>The website is currently under construction.</p>
      <h3>Micro-scale</h3>
      <p>
        The dungeon system and all modules are built around a 2x2 studs grid
        (15.8mm). Common battle map tile size is 1" or 25.4mm, which would
        correspond closer to a 3x3 or 4x4 grid. So why micro-scale?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          + Allows for larger dungeons on smaller tables
        </li>
        <li>
          + Less parts required, thus cheaper in price (in terms of LEGO®)
        </li>
        <li>
          + Compatible with LEGO® heroica sets and microfigures
        </li>
        <li>
          + Does not require too much storage space
        </li>
        <li>
          + Easily customizable
        </li>
        <li>
          - Not suitable for standard RPG miniatures or LEGO® minifigures
          (unless the grid size is extended, which is possible)
        </li>
        <li>
          - Can be fiddly with lots of microfigures
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Durable</h3>
      <p>
        The usage of loose or easily torn off parts is reduced to a minimum.
      </p>

      <h3>Connectable</h3>
      <p>
        Wall modules can be plugged together via technic bricks. When the wall
        modules are rejoined in any figure, there won't be any gaps when using
        the provided corner pieces.
      </p>

      <h3>Common parts</h3>
      <p>
        Most bricks used are common LEGO® bricks, that are usually available on
        bricklink. Some modules use more rare parts, that can be sometimes very
        expensive or not available at all. Those modules are marked with a

      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>
        The price for LEGO® bricks is not neccessarily cheap. All modules come
        in themes and sets, where certain parts are often reused on purpose
        within the set or theme, helping to further reduce shipping cost on
        bricklink.
      </p>
      <h3>Customizable</h3>
      <p>
        The beauty of LEGO® bricks is, it doesn't limit our creativity. All
        modules can be modified or rebuilt into whatever your dungeon has to
        offer!
      </p>
      <h3>Stackable</h3>
      <p>
        When the session is over, all wall modules can be put away safely,
        fitting next to each other, without having to fiddle with loose parts
        the next session.
